# Trailer-Lister
This is for my co-workers who are older and not very tech-savvy to be able to post custom listings to eBay Motors. It is a form with specs, but after it is entered, it will produce the HTML needed for the listing. This is for trailers specifically.


I have since left this job, so I am not sure if I will continue to work on this project
